# Multithread-Matrix-Multiplication-in-C

Multiplication of matrix does take time surely. Time complexity of matrix multiplication is O(n^3) using normal matrix multiplication. And Strassen algorithm improves it and its time complexity is O(n^(2.8074)).
But, Is there any way to improve the performance of matrix multiplication using the normal method. 
Multi-threading can be done to improve it. In multi-threading, instead of utilizing a single core of your processor, we utilizes all or more core to solve the problem.
